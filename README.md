# Problems

RobotRover Problem:

Just as defined in the problem, I have simulated the same.

Compile : g++ --std=c++11 RobotRover.cpp
Assumptions are : The Robot will start at (0,0) facing North in the beginning.


String Match:

There is vector which has list of strings to be compared with. You need to add the strings to list while creating a Finder Class.
Then issue Finder.find("sample-string") to compare

Compile : g++  --std=c++11 StringMatch.cpp
